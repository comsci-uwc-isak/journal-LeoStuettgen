In todays class we reviewed some of the material studied in the previous year which I found very helpful as it reminded me of some concepts I hadnt touched on in a long time. 
I really enjoyed the small but interesting slide about Blockchain and would like to learn more about that and maybe there is even a possibility to use this in my CS IA. Lets see...
I found the challenge very interesting and engaging. More of that!
This was a very different type and style of class than what we had in the previous year and I really enjoyed it. 

Second class. 
Started with some terminal and rapsery pi. Talking about the IA ideas and starting to further develop this process. 

Third class: 
We did some work on networks and worked through the different layers which are standardized and their real world applications. 
Later the python programming was very interesting. I feel the need to learn more syntax for python to improve in that. Also I felt the need, to review and trace the code later at home to better understand it.
